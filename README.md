The model you will be running is the one under `Transformer_Medium_SmoothedData` <br> 
You have to connect to TPUv2, or this will NOT WORK <be>  
Go to runtime->change runtime type <br>
Then select TPUv2 <br>
You will need Colab Pro, but sometimes Google allows anyone to connect to their TPUv2 -- give it a shot!
